# Elementary Neuron Net
> ðŸ‘¶ It is child's play with a self-written neural net 
>
This neural network has the next features:
 - Feed-Forward Neural Network or Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 
 - has a hidden layer
 - activation function: sigmoid
 - is fed with "full batch" (during one epoch weights adjustment is based on all training examples)
 - weights could be written/loaded to the file

MNIST database has been used for training http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
